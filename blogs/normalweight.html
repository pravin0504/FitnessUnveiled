    <p><h1>Your BMI falls within the normal weight range (between 18.5 and 24.9)<img class="obesity-imgcard" src="../Images/normalweight.jpeg" alt="normalweight"></h1></p> 
     <p>It suggests that you have a healthy weight in relation to your height. </p>
     <p>However, it's important to remember that BMI is just one measure of health, and it doesn't take into account other factors such as muscle mass, body composition, or overall fitness.</p>

    <p><em>Here are some general tips for maintaining and promoting good health when you have a normal BMI:</em></p>

    <p><b>Healthy Eating:</b> Continue to maintain a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats. Eating a variety of nutrient-dense foods is essential for overall well-being.</p>

    <p><b>Regular Exercise:</b> Engage in regular physical activity to stay fit and maintain good cardiovascular health. Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity aerobic exercise per week, along with strength training exercises at least two days a week.</p>

    <p><b>Stay Hydrated:</b> Drink plenty of water throughout the day to stay properly hydrated. Water is essential for various bodily functions.</p>

    <p><b>Monitor Health: </b>Even if your BMI is in the normal range, it's a good idea to have regular check-ups with your healthcare provider. They can assess other aspects of your health, such as blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and overall well-being.</p>

    <p><b>Manage Stress:</b> Find healthy ways to manage stress, as chronic stress can have a negative impact on your health. Techniques like meditation, deep breathing, and exercise can help reduce stress.</p>

    <p><b>Adequate Sleep:</b> Ensure you get enough quality sleep each night. Most adults need 7-9 hours of sleep to function optimally.</p>

    <p><b>Limit Alcohol and Avoid Smoking:</b> If you drink alcohol, do so in moderation. Avoid smoking or seek assistance to quit if you are a smoker.</p>

    <p><b>Mental Health: </b>Pay attention to your mental health. Seek support or professional help if you are dealing with stress, anxiety, or depression.</p>

    <p><b>Stay Informed:</b> Stay informed about health-related issues and make informed decisions about your health.</p>

    <p>Remember that individual health needs can vary, so it's important to consult with a healthcare professional who can provide personalized advice based on your specific circumstances. Additionally, maintaining a healthy lifestyle and preventing health problems is not solely about weight but encompasses various aspects of physical and mental well-being.</p>
