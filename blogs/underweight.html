    <p><h1> you have been classified as underweight (BMI less than 18.5) <img class="obesity-imgcard" src="../Images/underweight.jpeg" alt="underweight"></p></h1>
    <p>It's important to focus on gaining weight in a healthy and gradual manner to improve your overall health.</p>
    <p><em>Here are some reccomendations that you can take:</em></p>

    <p><b>Consult a Healthcare Professional: </b>Before making any significant changes to your diet or lifestyle, it's a good idea to consult with a healthcare provider or registered dietitian. They can assess your individual needs and provide personalized guidance.</p>
    
    <p><b>Increase Caloric Intake: </b>To gain weight, you'll need to consume more calories than your body burns in a day. Try to eat nutrient-dense foods that provide essential vitamins and minerals. Focus on whole grains, lean proteins, healthy fats, fruits, and vegetables.</p>
    
    <p><b>Eat Regularly: </b>Aim to have three main meals and several snacks throughout the day to ensure a consistent intake of calories. Don't skip meals or go long periods without eating.</p>
    
    <p><b>Choose Calorie-Rich Foods: </b>Include foods that are calorie-dense but also nutritious. Some examples include nuts, seeds, avocados, olive oil, whole-fat dairy products, and fatty fish like salmon.</p>
    
    <p><b>Protein Intake: </b>Ensure you are getting an adequate amount of protein, as it is essential for muscle development. Sources of protein include lean meats, poultry, fish, beans, legumes, and dairy products.</p>
    
    <p><b>Strength Training:</b> Engage in strength training exercises to build muscle mass. Muscle weighs more than fat, so increasing your muscle mass can help you gain weight in a healthy way. Consult a fitness professional for guidance on a suitable exercise program.</p>
    
    <p><b>Monitor Progress: </b>Keep track of your food intake, weight, and measurements to monitor your progress. Adjust your diet and exercise routine as needed to reach your goal weight gradually.</p>
    
    <p><b>Avoid Empty Calories: </b>While you're trying to gain weight, it's essential to focus on nutrient-rich foods rather than foods high in empty calories, such as sugary snacks and beverages.</p>
    
    <p><b>Stay Hydrated: </b>Drink plenty of water to stay hydrated, but avoid excessive consumption right before or during meals, as it can fill you up and reduce your appetite.</p>
    
    <p><b>Manage Stress: </b>Stress can affect your appetite and overall health. Practice stress-reduction techniques like meditation, yoga, or deep breathing exercises.</p>
    
    <p><b>Seek Support: </b>Talk to friends and family about your goals, and consider seeking the support of a counselor or therapist if you have concerns about body image or eating habits.</p>
    
    <p>Remember that healthy weight gain takes time, and it's important not to rush the process. Rapid weight gain can be detrimental to your health. Focus on making sustainable changes to your diet and lifestyle to achieve a healthy weight that is right for your body. Always consult with a healthcare professional for personalized guidance. </p>
